  <h1>SPACE</h1>
  
 <h2>HOW PLANETS GOT THEIR NAMES</h2>
 
  <h3>MERCURY</h3>
  
  <p>Named after the Roman messenger god, Mercury, known for his speed. This is fitting because Mercury is the fastest planet in its orbit around the Sun.</p>
  
  <h3>VENUS</h3>
  
  <p>Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. Its bright appearance in the sky made it associated with this goddess.</p>
  
  <h3>EARTH</h3>
  
  <p>The name "Earth" comes from Old English and Germanic words meaning "ground" or "soil." It is unique among planets because its name does not derive from mythology.</p>
  
  <h3>MARS</h3>
  
  <p>Mars is named after the Roman god of war, likely due to its reddish color resembling blood. In various cultures, this planet has often been associated with conflict.</p>
  
  <h3>JUPITER</h3>
  
  <p>Named after the king of the Roman gods, Jupiter, this planet is the largest in the solar system, fitting for a god associated with power and authority.</p>
  
  <h3>SATURN</h3>
  
  <p>Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture and time, who was also the father of Jupiter. Its name reflects its status as a prominent planet in the sky.</p>
  
  <h3>URANUS</h3>
  
  <p>Uranus is named after the Greek god of the sky, Ouranos. It was the first planet discovered with a telescope, and its name reflects its mythological roots.</p>
  
  <h3>NEPTUNE</h3>
  
  <p>Named after the Roman god of the sea, Neptune, this planet is associated with deep blue colors, reminiscent of the ocean.</p>
  
  <h3>PLUTO(FORMERLY A PLANET)</h3>
  
  <p>Named after the Roman god of the underworld, Pluto’s name was chosen in part due to its distant and cold nature. It was discovered in 1930.</p>
  
  <h3>EXTRASOLAR PLANETS</h3>
  
  <p>While not part of our solar system, it’s interesting to note that planets outside our solar system (exoplanets) are often named based on the star they orbit, combined with a letter designation (e.g., HD 209458 b).</p>
 
 
 <h2>FUN DID YOU KNOWS</h2>
 
 <p>Vastness of Space: The observable universe is about 93 billion light-years in diameter, filled with billions of galaxies, each containing millions or billions of stars.</p>
 
 <p>Black Holes: Once a star collapses into a black hole, its gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape, making them invisible to traditional telescopes.</p>
 
 <p>Space is Silent: In the vacuum of space, there’s no medium (like air) for sound to travel through, so space is completely silent.</p>
 
 <p>Day Length Variation: A day on Venus (243 Earth days) is longer than a year on Venus (225 Earth days) due to its slow rotation on its axis.</p>
 
 <p>Rogue Planets: There are planets that do not orbit any star, known as rogue planets. They drift through space, unbound to any solar system.</p>
 
 <p>Water in Space: Water has been found on the Moon, Mars, and even in the atmospheres of some exoplanets, suggesting that it might be more common in the universe than previously thought.</p>
 
 <p>Cosmic Background Radiation: The afterglow of the Big Bang can still be detected as cosmic microwave background radiation, which fills the universe and provides evidence of its origins.</p>
 
 <p>Neutron Stars: These incredibly dense remnants of supernova explosions can have a mass greater than that of the Sun, but be only about 20 kilometers in diameter!</p>
 
 <p>Time Dilation: According to Einstein’s theory of relativity, time moves slower in stronger gravitational fields. This means that time passes slightly faster for astronauts in space compared to people on Earth.</p>
 
 <p>The Great Attractor: Our galaxy, the Milky Way, is part of a massive gravitational pull towards a region in space known as the Great Attractor, which affects the motion of galaxies in our locah2>FUN DID YOU KNOWS<h2>
  
<h2>FUN FACTS</h2>

<p>Infinite Stars: There are more stars in the universe than grains of sand on all the Earth’s beaches combined!</p>

<p>Jupiter’s Great Red Spot: This massive storm on Jupiter is so big that three Earths could fit inside it.</p>

<p>Venus’ Day: A day on Venus (one full rotation) is longer than a year on Venus (one complete orbit around the Sun).</p>

<p>Moonquakes: The Moon experiences quakes too! They are called moonquakes and can last up to an hour.</p>

<p>Floating Astronauts: Astronauts on the International Space Station float because they are in a constant state of free fall around Earth.</p>

<p>Comet Tails: Comets have two tails: one made of gas and the other of dust, which always point away from the Sun due to solar wind.</p>

<p>Mars’ Olympus Mons: Olympus Mons is nearly three times the height of Mount Everest, making it the tallest volcano in the solar system.</p>

<p>Earth’s Speed: Earth travels through space at about 67,000 miles per hour (107,000 kilometers per hour) as it orbits the Sun.</p>

<p>Rings of Saturn: Saturn’s rings are made mostly of ice particles, with some rocky debris, and are incredibly thin—only about 30 feet (10 meters) thick.</p>

<p>Age of Light: Light from the Sun takes about 8 minutes to reach Earth, meaning we see the Sun as it was 8 minutes ago!</p>
