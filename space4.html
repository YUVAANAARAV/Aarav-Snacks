                    <h3>Mercury</h3>
                    <p>Named after the Roman messenger god, Mercury, known for his speed. This is fitting because Mercury is the fastest planet in its orbit around the Sun.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Venus</h3>
                    <p>Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty. Its bright appearance in the sky made it associated with this goddess.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Earth</h3>
                    <p>The name "Earth" comes from Old English and Germanic words meaning "ground" or "soil." It is unique among planets because its name does not derive from mythology.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Mars</h3>
                    <p>Mars is named after the Roman god of war, likely due to its reddish color resembling blood. In various cultures, this planet has often been associated with conflict.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Jupiter</h3>
                    <p>Named after the king of the Roman gods, Jupiter, this planet is the largest in the solar system, fitting for a god associated with power and authority.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Saturn</h3>
                    <p>Saturn is named after the Roman god of agriculture and time, who was also the father of Jupiter. Its name reflects its status as a prominent planet in the sky.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Uranus</h3>
                    <p>Uranus is named after the Greek god of the sky, Ouranos. It was the first planet discovered with a telescope, and its name reflects its mythological roots.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Neptune</h3>
                    <p>Named after the Roman god of the sea, Neptune, this planet is associated with deep blue colors, reminiscent of the ocean.</p>

                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Pluto (Formerly a Planet)</h3>
                    <p>Named after the Roman god of the underworld, Pluto's name was chosen in part due to its distant and cold nature. It was discovered in 1930.</p>

                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Extrasolar Planets</h3>
                    <p>While not part of our solar system, it's interesting to note that planets outside our solar system (exoplanets) are often named based on the star they orbit, combined with a letter designation (e.g., HD 209458 b).</p>

                    <p>The observable universe is about 93 billion light-years in diameter, filled with billions of galaxies, each containing millions or billions of stars.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Black Holes</h3>
                    <p>Once a star collapses into a black hole, its gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape, making them invisible to traditional telescopes.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>The Silent Void</h3>
                    <p>In the vacuum of space, there's no medium (like air) for sound to travel through, so space is completely silent.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Day Length Variation</h3>
                    <p>A day on Venus (243 Earth days) is longer than a year on Venus (225 Earth days) due to its slow rotation on its axis.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Rogue Planets</h3>
                    <p>There are planets that do not orbit any star, known as rogue planets. They drift through space, unbound to any solar system.</p>

                    <h3>Water in Space</h3>
                    <p>Water has been found on the Moon, Mars, and even in the atmospheres of some exoplanets, suggesting that it might be more common in the universe than previously thought.</p>

                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Cosmic Background Radiation</h3>
                    <p>The afterglow of the Big Bang can still be detected as cosmic microwave background radiation, which fills the universe and provides evidence of its origins.</p>

                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Neutron Stars</h3>
                    <p>These incredibly dense remnants of supernova explosions can have a mass greater than that of the Sun, but be only about 20 kilometers in diameter!</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>Time Dilation</h3>
                    <p>According to Einstein's theory of relativity, time moves slower in stronger gravitational fields. This means that time passes slightly faster for astronauts in space compared to people on Earth.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="fact-card">
                    <h3>The Great Attractor</h3>
                    <p>A massive gravitational force pulling galaxies, including the Milky Way, at 600 km/s, located 150-250 million light-years away. Its nature is still a mystery.</p>
